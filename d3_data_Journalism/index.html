          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2><br />

          <h4>Obesity Analysis</h4>

            <h5>Poverty</h5>
              <p>There may be a weak positive correlation between states that have higher poverity 
                percentages also have higher obesity rates. More statistical analysis would be 
                required to identify the significance for this correlation. </p>

            <h5>Age</h5>
                <p>There does not appear to be a correlation between obesity rates by age, but 
                  the dataset age range is only between 30 to 44. It appears that states known to have 
                  more outdoor recreational opportunities including UT, CA, CO, HI, have lower obesity rates 
                  despite the age range being from approximately 30-40 years of age.</p>

            <h5>Lacks Healthcare</h5>
                <p>There appears to be a correlation between obesity & household income. States with lower 
                  household income tend to have higher rates of obesity. </p>

          <h4>Smoking Analysis</h4>
            <h5>Poverty</h5>
              <p>There appears to be a weak positive correlation between smokers & poverty percentage. As the 
                percentage of poverty by state increases so does their rates of smokers. </p>

            <h5>Age</h5>
                <p>There does appear to be a clear correlation between smokers and age. However, the states with 
                  the highest rates of smoking >22% have average ages between 36-41. </p>

            <h5>Lacks Healthcare</h5>
                <p>There is a negative correlation between smokers and household income. Smoking rates 
                  increase as the household income decreases.</p>

          <h4>Lacking Healthcare Analysis</h4>
            <h5>Poverty</h5>
                <p>There is a weak to moderate positive correlation between lacking healthcare and poverty. As the 
                  percentage of people that lack healthcare increase so does the percentage of poverty. </p>

            <h5>Age</h5>
                <p>There does not appear to be a significant correlation between age and lacking healthcare. </p>

            <h5>Lacks Healthcare</h5>
                <p>There may be a weak negative  correlation between lacking healthcare and household income. As the 
                  household income decreases the percentage of people who lack healthcare appears to increase.</p>
