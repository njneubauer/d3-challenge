# Analysis of Obesity

## Poverty
* There may be a weak positive correlation between states that have higher poverity percentages also have higher obesity rates. More statistical analysis would be required to identify the significance for this correlation. 

## Age
* There does not appear to be a strong correlation between obesity rates by age, but the dataset age range is only between 30 to 44. 
  - It appears that states known to have more outdoor recreational opportunities including UT, CA, CO, HI, have lower obesity rates despite the age range being from approximately 30-40 years of age.

## Household Income
* There appears to be a correlation between obesity & household income. States with lower household income tend to have higher rates of obesity. 

# Analysis of Smoking

## Poverty 
* There appears to be a weak positive correlation between smokers & poverty percentage. As the percentage of poverty by state increases so does their rates of smokers. 

## Age
* There does appear to be a clear correlation between smokers and age. However, the states with the highest rates of smoking >22% have average ages between 36-41. 

## Household Income
* There is a strong negative correlation between smokers and household income. Smoking rates increase as the household income decreases.

# Analysis of Lacking Healthcare

## Poverty
* There is a weak to moderate positive correlation between lacking healthcare and poverty. As the percentage of people that lack healthcare increase so does the percentage of poverty. 

## Age
* There does not appear to be a significant correlation between age and lacking healthcare. 

## Household Income
* There may be a weak negative  correlation between lacking healthcare and household income. As the household income decreases the percentage of people who lack healthcare appears to increase.
